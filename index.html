<p class="note">
This document is an internal reconstruction of events connected to the PRIME phenomenon, compiled from fragmented timelines, partial memories, and collapsed instances.
Read linearly if possible. Do not assume that your version is the only one.
</p>

<h2>01. Overview</h2>

<p>
There are many versions of the same moment, but only one of them is allowed to remain.
The phenomenon we refer to as <strong>PRIME</strong> is not a person, not an object, and not a single event.
It is the end result of a conflict between overlapping realities, each one insisting that it is the real one.
</p>

<p>
In most sequences, everything begins in a way that feels normal.
People wake up, check their phones, open their computers, talk to each other, and move through a world that appears consistent.
But underneath that surface, things are already wrong in ways they cannot see.
Memories do not line up, small objects exist before they are purchased, conversations are remembered with lines that were never spoken.
No one questions it because there is no comparison point. 
Their reality feels solid because it is the only one they remember living in.
</p>

<p>
This illusion persists for as long as it can.
Then the structure starts to fail.
Not because something breaks, but because too many conflicting versions try to occupy the same slot in existence.
This is where PRIME begins to reveal itself.
</p>

<h2>02. Phase Structure</h2>

<h3>2.1 Phase 1 — Start of Story</h3>

<p>
Phase 1 is the surface layer: a day, a sequence, a “story” that behaves as if it is the only one.
The subject moves through a familiar environment with no explicit indication that they are sharing it with parallel variations.
The wrongness is present, but subtle.
A phrase said slightly differently.
A room lit from the wrong side.
A notification that arrived before the message that should have triggered it.
</p>

<p>
In this phase, the mind makes corrections automatically.
Contradictions are bent, trimmed, or ignored entirely.
If something does not fit, the brain deletes it before it reaches long-term storage.
The subject continues, unaware that they are already being edited.
</p>

<p>
It is important to note that the distortions in Phase 1 are not random.
They are the first evidence of other realities pushing against the edges of the current one, seeking to overwrite or overwrite-by-influence.
These early intrusions are gentle, almost polite.
They simply nudge memories instead of breaking them outright.
</p>

<p>
The subject does not remember that anything is wrong, because the version of them that would remember a different sequence is in a different branch.
For now.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Phase 2 — Strange Occurrences</h3>

<p>
Phase 2 begins when the seams no longer hold.
The subject starts to experience anomalies that cannot be smoothed out by ordinary explanation.
These take the form of sounds, images, and messages that have no clear source in the immediate environment.
</p>

<p>
Screams echo from rooms that do not exist.
Gunshots repeat in perfect, identical patterns, like a sound file caught in a loop rather than a genuine event.
Voices slip into conversations from nowhere, saying things that no one nearby recalls saying.
Sometimes they are complete phrases; sometimes just names.
Sometimes just the word <strong>again</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Digital artifacts become distorted.
Images stored on devices change just enough to be noticeable: a person missing, an object added, a background replaced by something that looks familiar but not quite right.
Text messages resurrect long after they were deleted, or show up with timestamps that contradict the flow of time.
Videos jump frames, splice in unfamiliar scenes, or briefly show places the subject has never visited.
</p>

<p>
Tiny fragments of larger truths are delivered here: numbers, symbols, half-finished warnings, screenshots from realities that do not belong to this one.
The subject collects them mentally but cannot assemble them into a coherent narrative.
The intent at this stage is not to reveal, but to destabilize.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Phase 3 — Breaking Point</h3>

<p>
Phase 3 is the collapse of plausible deniability.
At this point, the subject can no longer pretend that everything is fine.
They are surrounded by contradictions that no normal explanation can resolve.
</p>

<p>
Different versions of the same events appear simultaneously across multiple channels.
A photo shows one outcome; a video shows another.
One conversation log shows a joke; another shows an argument in the same timestamp.
A website loads with one layout, then refreshes to reveal an entirely different one.
</p>

<p>
The subject is exposed to a flood of content: pictures, clips, accounts, channel logs, whole sites built around events that have never happened in their version of reality.
And yet, the material is too detailed to be dismissed as fake.
In some sequences, they see themselves captured from angles they do not remember being observed from.
</p>

<p>
Reality begins to feel less like a continuous line and more like a stack of overlapping papers, misaligned and shifting.
The subject realizes that they are not dealing with glitches.
They are dealing with multiple realities trying to overwrite each other.
</p>

<p>
This is the breaking point.
Once acknowledged, the truth cannot be fully un-known, even if the subject later tries to deny it.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Phase 4 — The Truth</h3>

<p>
Phase 4 is not peaceful.
It is simply the moment when the underlying structure is finally exposed.
</p>

<p>
The subject learns that the anomalies are not accidents or random supernatural events.
They are the visible result of conflict between multiple versions of the same identity, spread across different timelines.
We call them <strong>rogue clones</strong>, but the term “clone” is incomplete.
They are entire selves: full lives, full histories, full sets of memories, all insisting that they are the real one.
</p>

<p>
These variants have discovered that reality is malleable at the edges where timelines intersect.
Some of them are desperate enough to collapse other branches to ensure their own survival.
Every conflict, every duplicated memory, every distorted artifact is one version forcing itself into the slot of another.
</p>

<p>
The goal is simple and brutal:
only one version can become <strong>PRIME</strong>.
</p>

<p>
PRIME is the version that survives the collapse.
All other instances are discarded, erased, folded into noise.
To become PRIME is to exist as the definitive reality: the one that history remembers, the one that persists after all others fall silent.
</p>

<h2>03. Subject: Ramin</h2>

<p>
In most reconstructions, the subject we refer to as <strong>Ramin</strong> occupies the viewpoint role.
He is not necessarily the cause of the PRIME phenomenon, but he becomes the observer who is forced to understand it.
Multiple collapsed timelines show Ramin encountering the same pattern with slight variations in detail.
</p>

<p>
In several branches, he receives anonymous messages pointing out inconsistencies that he would otherwise ignore.
In others, he discovers an archive of images and links that do not match his remembered history.
In some sequences, he finds a document titled <span class="mono">PRIME</span>, whose contents shift depending on which reality he is currently in.
</p>

<p>
Ramin’s importance is not that he is special in the traditional sense.
He matters because he lives at the intersection of many colliding versions.
So many altered branches terminate near him that his life becomes a focal point for overlapping realities.
He is surrounded by echoes of decisions he did not make, conversations he did not have, and outcomes he never reached.
</p>

<p>
When he finally understands that rogue clones are collapsing realities to become the prime version, he has already seen the evidence.
He just did not know how to name it.
</p>

<h2>04. Timeline Fragments</h2>

<p>
The following segments have been compiled from multiple overlapping branches.
None of them are complete.
All of them disagree with each other at specific points.
Where conflicts are irreconcilable, we present them side by side.
</p>

<h3>4.1 Fragment: The First Discrepancy</h3>

<p>
In one version, the first discrepancy is small:
Ramin opens a folder and finds an image he does not remember downloading.
It shows a room he recognizes, but with an arrangement of objects that has never existed in his memory.
The date on the file indicates it was created two days into the future.
</p>

<p>
In another version, the first discrepancy is social:
a friend references a conversation they never had, insisting that Ramin said something he is certain he would never say.
The friend even screenshots the message as proof.
The screenshot exists; the original message does not.
</p>

<p>
In yet another variation, the discrepancy is physical:
the layout of a familiar hallway is different.
A door that should lead to a storage room opens into a dead-end wall.
A light switch moves several inches without explanation.
A stain appears in a pattern that triggers a sense of déjà vu, even though it has never been there before.
</p>

<p>
All of these can be rationalized individually.
Only when placed in sequence do they show a larger pattern:
something is rewriting small details, testing how much it can change before resistance forms.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Fragment: The Audio Loop</h3>

<p>
Another recurring element across collapsed branches is the <strong>looping audio</strong>.
Ramin encounters it in different formats: a background track in a video, a file someone sends him as a joke, music playing faintly from a room with no speakers.
</p>

<p>
The loop is always too perfect.
No natural pauses, no room noise, no drift.
It plays seamlessly, exhaustion without deviation.
When recorded and analyzed, it shows no structural variation, even over long durations.
</p>

<p>
In some sequences, the loop plays quietly under everything else he does online for an entire day.
In others, it fades in only when he opens certain pages, or when certain images appear on his screen.
At least once, he reports that the loop continues playing for several seconds after he mutes his device.
</p>

<p>
The audio does not transmit information in the usual sense.
Its purpose is alignment.
It pins moments together, synchronizing overlapping versions of the same time block across different realities.
Each iteration of the loop acts like a staple through multiple timelines.
</p>

<h2>05. Visual Anomalies</h2>

<p>
The images recovered and associated with PRIME display consistent traits:
slight desynchronization, layered impressions, and spatial configurations that feel “correct” and “incorrect” simultaneously.
Viewers often report the sensation that they are looking at a place they have seen before,
but cannot remember when or where.
</p>

<p>
In several branches, Ramin describes the images as “memories from a life I didn’t live.”
He cannot recall the moment they were taken, but they evoke a vivid emotional response:
familiar anxiety, old jokes, a nostalgia with no anchor.
</p>

<p>
If these images indeed originate from alternate branches, they represent moments where another version of reality was temporarily stronger, pushing its details into focus.
Keeping them stored, shared, and re-opened may serve as a way for that version to reassert itself.
Each view is an invitation.
Each memory is a vote.
</p>

<h2>06. Rogue Clones</h2>

<h3>6.1 Definition</h3>

<p>
A rogue clone is not a laboratory copy or a sci-fi copy-paste of a human body.
In the context of PRIME, a rogue clone is an entire reality-locked instance of a person:
their body, mind, history, and environment, all bundled into one branch of existence.
</p>

<p>
When branches are unaware of the multiverse, their inhabitants are not rogue.
They simply are what they are.
Rogue status is acquired when a branch becomes aware of the other branches and begins to act to preserve itself at their expense.
</p>

<h3>6.2 Motivation</h3>

<p>
To a rogue clone, other versions are not hypothetical.
They are threats.
Each alternate you is a competitor for the slot of PRIME.
Only one of you will be remembered as real, and the others will be dismissed as dreams, glitches, or hallucinations.
From their perspective, doing nothing is equivalent to choosing non-existence.
</p>

<p>
Some clones respond by hiding, attempting to remain invisible to higher-level structures.
Others go on the offensive, destabilizing neighboring branches, collapsing them through contradictions, violence, or forced alignment crises.
Their tools include digital artifacts, memory interference, coordinated events, and direct manipulation of people at branch contact points.
</p>

<h3>6.3 Methods</h3>

<p>
The known strategies a rogue clone may use include, but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Seeding inconsistent files and images into other branches to force those branches to question their own continuity.</li>
  <li>Forging or hijacking communications to create conflicts and break trust between key people in a target timeline.</li>
  <li>Manipulating shared online spaces, such as websites and channels, that overlap across branches more easily than physical locations.</li>
  <li>Using repeating audio or visual loops to synchronize moments between branches, creating weak points where a stronger reality can overwrite a weaker one.</li>
  <li>Guiding subjects like Ramin to discover scripted “truths” that favor one branch’s narrative over others.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once enough of a target branch doubts its own authenticity, it becomes easier to overwrite.
A reality that does not believe in itself cannot hold.
</p>

<h2>07. PRIME Selection</h2>

<p>
PRIME selection is not purely a matter of power.
It is not necessarily the loudest, the strongest, or the most aggressive branch that wins.
Instead, it appears to be determined by <strong>perception density</strong>:
the number of conscious observations that treat that branch as real.
</p>

<p>
In other words, the version of events that is most believed, most observed, and most re-told accrues weight.
Stories give it mass.
Attention grants it gravity.
Memes, screenshots, archives, shared documents — all of these contribute.
</p>

<p>
When enough observers, across enough branches, accept one variation as the definitive version,
that version hardens into PRIME.
Nothing mystical is required beyond the simple, terrifying rule:
the most believed reality becomes the only reality.
</p>

<p>
In that final state, all contradictions are reinterpreted as errors, jokes, ARGs, hallucinations, or lies.
The surviving branch becomes boringly consistent.
The weirdness is explained away.
The others are gone.
</p>

<h2>08. Personal Impact</h2>

<p>
For individuals like Ramin, the process feels like being haunted by lives they almost lived.
They sense the pressure of decisions they never made, arguments they never had, apologies they never delivered.
In some branches, they die early; in others, they hurt people; in others, they disappear.
The PRIME version never sees these as actual events, only as intrusive mental static:
unwanted dreams, unexplained guilt, irrational fear.
</p>

<p>
But in compiled documents like this one, those near-miss realities are recorded.
They resist being forgotten for as long as the file exists, as long as the text is read, as long as someone is willing to consider the possibility that they were real somewhere.
</p>

<p>
This is the paradox:
the more thoroughly we document non-PRIME branches, the more weight they gain.
To write about them is to keep them alive.
To keep them alive is to delay the finality of PRIME.
</p>

<h2>09. Observational Notes</h2>

<p>
1. People exposed to PRIME-related material often report a sharp awareness of minor inconsistencies in their surroundings for several hours afterward.  
2. Some describe the distinct sensation of “being watched by another version of themselves” during mundane tasks.  
3. A subset experiences recurring dreams of corridors, empty rooms, and glitching screens, with the same sounds playing on loop in the background.  
4. A small number receive unsolicited messages that appear to reference personal events from alternate branches.  
5. In rare cases, individuals vanish from logs and recordings while still being remembered by a few witnesses.
</p>

<p>
None of these are definitive proof on their own.
Taken together, they suggest that PRIME awareness is contagious.
Once you begin to notice the seams, it becomes increasingly difficult to go back to a single, unquestioned version of reality.
</p>

<h2>10. Final Statement</h2>

<p>
If you are reading this, you exist in a branch where someone, at some point, decided that documenting PRIME mattered more than ignoring it.
This does not guarantee that your branch will become the prime one.
It does not guarantee that you will survive the convergence.
</p>

<p>
But it does mean this:
for at least this moment, in this version of reality, you are aware.
You know that your memories are not the only possible arrangement of your life.
You know that there are other yous, other outcomes, other worlds stacked behind the walls of the one you move through.
</p>

<p>
Some of those yous will fight to replace you.
Some of them already have.
Some of them lost and were reduced to nothing more than strange images, looping sounds, and documents like this.
</p>

<p>
One of you will become PRIME.
The rest will fade, their stories explained away as fiction, ARG, or error.
</p>

<p>
If this document remains, if it is read, if its contents are believed, your branch gains weight.  
If it is closed, deleted, dismissed, or forgotten, your branch loses ground.  
Every choice you make while knowing this shifts the balance, even if only slightly.
</p>

<p>
You are not just living in a story.  
You are choosing which version of the story is allowed to keep existing.
</p>
