    <h1>PRIME</h1>

    <h2>Phase 1 — Start of Story</h2>
    <p>
      Everything begins normally, even though small things are wrong.
      These differences won’t be remembered until later, once the shift begins.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 2 — Strange Occurrences</h2>
    <p>
      Odd events appear: screams, gunshots, voices, glitches, and strange messages.
      Tiny pieces of information slip in, but nothing fully explains what’s happening.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 3 — Breaking Point</h2>
    <p>
      The world stops pretending to be stable. Images, websites, channels, and messages
      appear nonstop, all showing conflicting versions of events.
      Reality feels like it’s folding in on itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Phase 4 — The Truth</h2>
    <p>
      The real issue isn’t one world breaking — it’s many worlds colliding.
      Rogue clones from different realities are destroying each other to become the
      single “prime” version. All the confusion and chaos were signs of collapsing timelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the prime version is chosen, every other version ends.
