<p class="note">
This document is an internal reconstruction of events connected to the PRIME phenomenon, compiled from fragmented timelines, partial memories, and collapsed instances.
</p>

<h2>01. Overview</h2>

<p>
There are many versions of the same moment, but only one is allowed to remain.
The phenomenon called PRIME is not a person or an object. It is the end result of conflict between overlapping realities.
</p>

<p>
People begin normally, unaware of the discrepancies around them. Memories shift without warning. Objects appear in states they were never in. Conversations include lines that were never spoken.
</p>

<p>
This illusion persists until the weight of contradictions becomes too large to sustain. This is where PRIME begins to form.
</p>

<h2>02. Phase Structure</h2>

<h3>2.1 Phase 1 — Start of Story</h3>

<p>
Phase 1 resembles a stable world. People continue through familiar routines, unaware that their timeline is being subtly edited. Small differences are rationalized automatically. Rooms shift layout, timestamps adjust, messages appear out of order.
</p>

<p>
These are not random errors. They are pressure from other branches attempting to overwrite this one.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Phase 2 — Strange Occurrences</h3>

<p>
Screams and voices echo from empty rooms. Gunshot sounds loop too perfectly. Digital images distort slightly. Messages reappear after deletion.
</p>

<p>
Fragments of information leak through: symbols, cryptic warnings, inconsistent screenshots. None reveal the complete truth, but all destabilize confidence in the current timeline.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Phase 3 — Breaking Point</h3>

<p>
Contradictions overwhelm the subject. Images and logs conflict with known events. Videos show outcomes that never occurred. Websites shift layout upon refresh.
</p>

<p>
Reality stops behaving like a single continuous line. It becomes layered and unstable.
</p>

<h3>2.4 Phase 4 — The Truth</h3>

<p>
The subject learns that the anomalies are results of contact between multiple versions of the same identity across many realities. Rogue clones from alternate branches attempt to destroy competing branches.
</p>

<p>
Their purpose is simple: only one version can remain. Only one timeline becomes PRIME.
</p>

<h2>03. Subject: [REDACTED]</h2>

<p>
In most reconstructions, the subject known as [REDACTED] becomes the focal point. [REDACTED] is not the cause, but is positioned at the intersection of multiple collapsing branches.
</p>

<p>
Across variants, [REDACTED] encounters inconsistencies, altered files, anonymous warnings, and images from timelines that do not match the one they remember living in.
</p>

<p>
[REDACTED] becomes aware of the conflict only after the breaking point, when the number of contradictions can no longer be hidden by memory.
</p>

<h2>04. Timeline Fragments</h2>

<h3>4.1 Fragment: The First Discrepancy</h3>

<p>
In one branch, [REDACTED] finds an image of a familiar room arranged incorrectly with a date from the future. In another, a friend references a conversation that never happened, backed by a screenshot that exists without origin.
</p>

<p>
In yet another, the layout of a hallway changes permanently. None of these alone would trigger suspicion, but together they indicate active interference.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Fragment: The Audio Loop</h3>

<p>
Across multiple collapsed branches, [REDACTED] hears the same looping audio. The loop is unnaturally perfect, with no variation or noise. Sometimes it continues after muting the device.
</p>

<p>
The loop synchronizes moments between overlapping realities, anchoring them for possible overwrites.
</p>

<h2>05. Visual Anomalies</h2>

<p>
Images connected to PRIME display layered impressions and spatial inconsistencies. People report familiarity with locations they have never visited.
</p>

<p>
These likely originate from alternate branches temporarily stronger than this one.
</p>

<h2>06. Rogue Clones</h2>

<h3>6.1 Definition</h3>

<p>
A rogue clone is an entire timeline-locked instance of a person: complete history, memory, and identity. They become rogue once they learn other versions exist.
</p>

<h3>6.2 Motivation</h3>

<p>
To a rogue clone, other versions are threats. Each wants to be the one selected as PRIME.
</p>

<h3>6.3 Methods</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Seeding inconsistent files to weaken the target branch</li>
  <li>Manipulating communication logs</li>
  <li>Hijacking shared online spaces</li>
  <li>Using loops to synchronize timelines</li>
  <li>Pushing subjects like [REDACTED] toward narrative collapse</li>
</ul>

<h2>07. PRIME Selection</h2>

<p>
PRIME is selected by perception density.  
The version most believed, documented, viewed, or remembered becomes the surviving branch.
</p>

<p>
Attention gives a timeline mass.  
Documentation gives it weight.  
Memory gives it strength.
</p>

<h2>08. Personal Impact</h2>

<p>
For [REDACTED], the process feels like being haunted by lives they did not live. Emotions tied to events that never happened surface without explanation.
</p>

<p>
This document keeps non-PRIME branches alive as long as it is read.
</p>

<h2>09. Observational Notes</h2>

<p>
1. People exposed to PRIME anomalies notice inconsistencies in their surroundings.  
2. Many feel watched by another version of themselves.  
3. Some dream of empty rooms and glitching screens with loops playing.  
4. Some receive messages referencing alternate events.  
5. A few vanish from logs while being remembered by others.
</p>

<h2>10. Final Statement</h2>

<p>
If you are reading this, your branch is temporarily gaining weight. Knowledge shifts the balance. Every observation affects PRIME selection.
</p>

<p class="mono">
PRIME IS A CONSEQUENCE.
