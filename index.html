<h1>PRIME</h1>

<h2>Phase 1 — Start of Story</h2>
<p>
Everything begins the same way it always has. At least, that’s what it feels like.  
Routine remains intact, daily life moves forward, and nothing appears broken on the surface.  
But the foundation is already wrong in ways no one can articulate.
</p>

<p>
Small details do not line up.  
Memories do not match the world they belong to.  
Objects seem older or newer than they should be.  
People remember events that never happened, or forget ones that absolutely did.  
But the mind smooths these contradictions out automatically, refusing to process the error.  
This denial continues until Phase 2.
</p>

<p>
The participant is surrounded by inconsistencies, but they cannot recognize them yet.  
Their version of reality is only one among many, and those versions are beginning to rub against each other.  
The seams have not split open — but they are weakening.
</p>



<h2>Phase 2 — Strange Occurrences</h2>
<p>
Things begin slipping out of alignment.  
Sounds echo from places where there are no people.  
Screams carry across distances that should be silent.  
Gunshots repeat in loops far too perfect to be natural.  
Voices whisper fragmented sentences without context or source.
</p>

<p>
Files change when no one touches them.  
Images appear slightly distorted, as if the subject shifted between frames.  
Text changes meaning when reread.  
Fragments of conversations repeat from alternate versions of the same moment.
</p>

<p>
Hints start leaking through: tiny clues, incomplete symbols, unfinished warnings.  
None of them reveal the truth — they simply destabilize the participant enough to make them doubt their recollection.
</p>

<p>
This is where the first cracks appear.  
Not in the world itself, but in the participant’s confidence in their world.
</p>



<h2>Phase 3 — Breaking Point</h2>
<p>
The world stops pretending.
</p>

<p>
Contradictions pile up in layers.  
Images, videos, channels, messages, websites — all conflicting, all simultaneous, all impossible to fit into one timeline.  
Multiple versions of the same person appear in different contexts.  
Events contradict previous events.  
Timelines overlap and then tear apart.
</p>

<p>
Every direction the participant looks, they encounter inconsistencies.  
Versions of reality collide, stack, break apart, and recombine in ways that feel violent, overwhelming, and hostile.
</p>

<p>
The noise becomes constant.  
The participant can no longer pretend this is a glitch, a coincidence, or a prank.  
Reality itself is unstable.
</p>

<p>
Pieces of the truth start surfacing — not enough to form a full explanation, but enough to reveal that the cause isn’t supernatural randomness.  
Something is intentionally breaking the lines between worlds.
</p>



<h2>Phase 4 — The Truth</h2>
<p>
The truth is not that one world is breaking apart.  
The truth is that countless worlds are trying to occupy the same space.
</p>

<p>
Multiple versions of the same people exist across different realities.  
These versions are not passive.  
They are aware of each other.  
And they are at war.
</p>

<p>
Rogue clones — alternate selves — move through collapsing timelines, destroying versions that threaten their existence.  
Each version believes it has the right to survive.  
Each one believes it is the closest to “complete.”
</p>

<p>
But only one version can become the prime.
</p>

<p>
This is why memories change.  
Why files distort.  
Why voices overlap.  
Why entire events shift between interpretations.  
The participant has been caught in the gravitational pull of collapsing timelines — a multiverse folding inward as competing versions fight to become singular.
</p>

<p>
When Ramin learns the truth, everything retroactively makes sense:  
the screams, the gunfire, the fractures, the loops, the glitches, the distortions, the contradictions.
</p>

<p>
These were not symptoms of a broken world.  
They were symptoms of too many worlds colliding at once.
</p>

<p>
Only one version can survive the collapse.  
When the prime is chosen, every other timeline — and every other self — is erased.
</p>

<p>
This is the end of the multiverse.  
This is the beginning of the prime.
</p>
