      <h2>Start of Story</h2>
      <p>
        Everything begins normally, or at least it appears that way.
        Small details are off, timelines are slightly wrong, and familiar things feel different,
        but no one fully notices yet. The differences are there, quietly waiting, but they will
        only truly be remembered later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reality continues as usual on the surface. Underneath, it is already bending.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-label">Phase 2</div>
      <h2>Strange Occurrences</h2>
      <p>
        The cracks start to show.
      </p>
      <p>
        Distant screams. Echoes of gunfire. Voices that don’t belong to anyone in the room.
        Glitches in conversations, in files, in memories. Things move when no one touches them,
        messages appear with no sender, and the world feels just slightly more hostile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tiny fragments of information slip through: symbols, phrases, half-complete warnings.
        Nothing is enough to explain what’s happening, but it is enough to make them uneasy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-label">Phase 3</div>
      <h2>Breaking Point</h2>
      <p>
        The pattern stops pretending to be normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pictures. Websites. Channels. Messages. Everything floods in at once:
        conflicting versions of the same events, different outcomes of the same day,
        faces that are almost right but not quite. The noise becomes constant.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is surrounded by contradictions, by versions, by evidence that cannot all be true
        at the same time. The only possible conclusion is that something deeper is wrong
        with reality itself.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="section-label">Phase 4</div>
      <h2>The Truth</h2>
      <p>
        The truth is not that the world is breaking.
        The truth is that too many worlds are trying to exist at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rogue clones, divergent versions of the same people, are collapsing realities in
        an attempt to become the single, dominant timeline — the <strong>prime</strong> version.
        Every inconsistency, every echo, every glitch was a collision between those realities,
        each one fighting not to be erased.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Ramin finally understands this, the pattern makes sense:
        the screams, the weapons, the broken media, the missing memories.
        It was never random. It was a war of identities, and only one version is allowed to remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the prime version is chosen, all the others end.
